## Full Research

Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is a short-term approach to couples therapy based on attachment science. It focuses on understanding and changing the negative interaction patterns that cause distress in relationships. EFT helps partners identify their core attachment needs and fears (e.g., fear of abandonment, fear of rejection) and express underlying vulnerable emotions (like sadness, fear, shame) rather than secondary reactive emotions (like anger or withdrawal). The goal is to restructure the emotional bond between partners, creating a more secure and responsive connection.

**Theoretical background:** EFT integrates attachment theory, experiential therapy (focusing on emotional experience), and systems theory (understanding interaction patterns).

**Effectiveness:** EFT is considered one of the most rigorously researched and effective approaches to couples therapy. Numerous studies and meta-analyses show high rates of recovery and significant improvements in relationship satisfaction for couples undergoing EFT. Effects appear to be stable over time.
