# Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT)

## Steps

1.  Assess relationship satisfaction and problematic behaviors.
2.  Train communication skills (e.g., active listening, I-statements).
3.  Introduce positive behavior exchanges (increase reinforcement).
4.  Practice problem-solving techniques for conflicts.
5.  Build maintenance plans for sustaining positive relationship patterns.

## Full Research

Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT), including approaches like Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT), focuses on changing specific problematic behaviors within a relationship. Traditional BCT emphasizes increasing positive interactions (behavior exchange) and improving communication and problem-solving skills. IBCT adds an emphasis on emotional acceptance, helping partners understand and tolerate differences and difficult emotions rather than solely focusing on change.

**Theoretical background:** BCT is grounded in social learning theory and behavioral principles, focusing on reinforcement patterns and skill deficits. IBCT incorporates principles of acceptance and emotional validation.

**Effectiveness:** BCT and its variants like IBCT are well-established, evidence-based treatments for relationship distress. Research shows they lead to significant improvements in relationship satisfaction and communication. Compared to EFT, BCT might focus more on skill-building and direct behavior change, while IBCT adds a crucial acceptance component.
