# Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)

## Steps

1.  Identify target traumatic memories and associated beliefs.
2.  Set up dual attention stimulus (eye movements, tapping, or tones).
3.  Guide client through sets of stimulation while recalling the memory.
4.  Pause to process emerging thoughts, images, or emotions.
5.  Continue until distress reduces, then install positive self-beliefs.

## Full Research

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an approach designed to alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories. After identifying a specific traumatic memory and associated negative belief, the therapist guides the client through sets of bilateral stimulation (e.g., eye movements, taps, or tones) while the client focuses on the memory. The process continues until the memory becomes less disturbing and is associated with a more positive self-belief.

**Theoretical background:** The exact mechanism of EMDR is still debated, but the Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) model suggests that trauma can cause memories to be stored dysfunctionally. EMDR, particularly the bilateral stimulation component, is thought to facilitate the brain's natural information processing system, allowing the traumatic memory to be integrated adaptively.

**Effectiveness:** EMDR is recognized by major health organizations as an effective treatment for PTSD. Meta-analyses and clinical trials generally find EMDR to be effective in reducing PTSD symptoms, often comparable to trauma-focused CBT approaches like PE and CPT. Some debate exists regarding whether the eye movements themselves are essential or if the exposure component is the primary driver of change.
