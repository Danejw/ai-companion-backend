# Prolonged Exposure (PE)

## Steps

1.  Psychoeducation about PTSD and rationale for exposure.
2.  Construct an in vivo exposure hierarchy for trauma reminders.
3.  Conduct imaginal exposure (recount traumatic event in detail).
4.  Assign homework: listen to exposure recordings and confront avoided situations.
5.  Review progress, modify exposures, and consolidate emotional processing.

## Full Research

Prolonged Exposure (PE) is a specific type of exposure therapy designed to treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It helps individuals gradually approach trauma-related memories, feelings, and situations that they have been avoiding. PE typically involves two main components: imaginal exposure (revisiting the traumatic memory in detail in a safe therapeutic setting) and in vivo exposure (confronting feared but safe situations, places, or people in real life).

**Theoretical background:** PE is based on emotional processing theory, which suggests that PTSD symptoms arise from incomplete processing of the traumatic memory and associated emotions. Exposure helps individuals process the trauma memory and learn that trauma-related cues are not inherently dangerous, reducing fear and avoidance.

**Effectiveness:** PE is considered a first-line, evidence-based treatment for PTSD. Numerous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated its effectiveness in significantly reducing PTSD symptoms, depression, and anxiety in individuals who have experienced various types of trauma. It performs comparably to other leading trauma-focused therapies like CPT and EMDR.
