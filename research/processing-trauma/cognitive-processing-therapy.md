# Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)

## Steps

1.  Explain PTSD and the role of "stuck points" (distorted beliefs).
2.  Have the client write a detailed trauma narrative.
3.  Identify cognitive distortions (e.g., self-blame, guilt).
4.  Use worksheets to challenge and restructure unhelpful beliefs.
5.  Reinforce adaptive beliefs and generalize skills to other life areas.

## Full Research

Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is another evidence-based treatment primarily used for PTSD. It focuses on how the individual views the self, others, and the world after experiencing trauma. CPT helps clients identify and challenge unhelpful or distorted beliefs (often called "stuck points") related to the trauma, particularly those concerning safety, trust, power/control, esteem, and intimacy. Therapy involves writing about the trauma (impact statement) and using cognitive techniques and worksheets to examine and modify maladaptive thoughts.

**Theoretical background:** CPT is based on social cognitive theory, suggesting that trauma can dramatically alter fundamental beliefs, and these altered beliefs maintain PTSD symptoms. By identifying and modifying these beliefs, symptoms can be reduced.

**Effectiveness:** CPT is recognized as a highly effective, first-line treatment for PTSD across various populations and trauma types. Research, including numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses, shows that CPT leads to significant reductions in PTSD and comorbid symptoms, comparable in efficacy to other trauma-focused therapies like PE.
