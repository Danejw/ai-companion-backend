# Grief-Focused CBT

## Steps

1.  Identify unhelpful grief-related thoughts and avoidance patterns.
2.  Conduct imaginal exposure to painful loss memories.
3.  Challenge distorted beliefs about guilt, self-blame, or future hopelessness.
4.  Develop a narrative that honors the lost loved one and affirms life.
5.  Rebuild life engagement through goal setting and reactivation.

## Full Research

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can also be adapted to address grief, particularly when grief symptoms are prolonged or accompanied by significant depression or anxiety. Grief-Focused CBT applies standard CBT techniques to the context of loss. This includes identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts related to the loss (e.g., excessive guilt, catastrophic thinking about the future), using exposure techniques to process painful memories or confront avoided reminders, and employing behavioral activation to help the bereaved individual gradually re-engage with meaningful activities and relationships.

**Theoretical background:** Views prolonged or complicated grief responses as maintained by maladaptive cognitions and avoidance behaviors, similar to anxiety or depression.

**Effectiveness:** CBT-based interventions for grief have shown effectiveness in reducing grief severity and related psychopathology (like depression) compared to control groups or non-specific support, particularly for individuals with more complicated grief reactions. Recent research suggests CBT can be more effective than mindfulness interventions for prolonged grief symptoms over time.
