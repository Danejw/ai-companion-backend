# Complicated Grief Therapy (CGT)

## Steps

1.  Provide psychoeducation about complicated grief.
2.  Guide imaginal revisiting exercises of the death event.
3.  Encourage situational exposures to reminders avoided after loss.
4.  Identify and restructure problematic grief-related beliefs.
5.  Support reconnection to meaningful life goals and relationships.

## Full Research

Complicated Grief Therapy (CGT), now often referred to as treatment for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), is a targeted intervention for individuals experiencing intense, persistent, and disabling grief that significantly interferes with functioning long after a loss. CGT adapts techniques from IPT and CBT/exposure therapy. Key components include psychoeducation about grief, processing the story of the death (imaginal revisiting), confronting avoided situations related to the loss (situational exposure), addressing maladaptive thoughts, and working on restoring a sense of purpose and connection to life.

**Theoretical background:** CGT draws on attachment theory (understanding grief as related to broken bonds) and cognitive-behavioral principles (addressing avoidance and maladaptive cognitions).

**Effectiveness:** CGT has demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials for treating complicated/prolonged grief, showing superiority over standard grief counseling or IPT alone for this specific condition. It helps reduce the intensity of grief symptoms and improve overall functioning.
