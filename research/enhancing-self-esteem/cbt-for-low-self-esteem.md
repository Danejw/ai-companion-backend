2.  Challenge global negative self-evaluations using evidence and logic.

4.  Build self-affirmation and self-compassion practices.
5.  Reinforce mastery experiences to consolidate improved self-image.

## Full Research

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) approaches for low self-esteem target the negative core beliefs and assumptions individuals hold about themselves (e.g., "I am worthless," "I am unlovable"). Therapy involves identifying these beliefs, understanding their origins, and challenging their validity through cognitive restructuring (examining evidence for and against the belief) and behavioral experiments (testing the beliefs in real-world situations). The goal is to develop a more balanced and realistic view of the self.

**Theoretical background:** Based on cognitive theory, suggesting that negative core beliefs drive negative automatic thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that maintain low self-esteem.

**Effectiveness:** CBT interventions specifically targeting low self-esteem have demonstrated effectiveness in improving self-worth and reducing related symptoms like depression and anxiety. Models like Fennell's CBT for low self-esteem have supporting evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses.
