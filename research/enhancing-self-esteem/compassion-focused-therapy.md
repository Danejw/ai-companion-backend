# Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT)

## Steps

1.  Psychoeducation on emotion systems (threat, drive, soothe).
2.  Develop compassionate imagery (create a compassionate self).
3.  Practice soothing techniques (e.g., rhythm breathing).
4.  Engage in exercises fostering self-kindness over self-criticism.
5.  Apply compassion skills to difficult memories and daily self-talk.

## Full Research

Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT), developed by Paul Gilbert, is particularly helpful for individuals with high levels of self-criticism and shame, often linked to low self-esteem. CFT integrates evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and attachment theory with cognitive and behavioral techniques. It emphasizes cultivating self-compassion by understanding the three basic emotion regulation systems (threat, drive, soothing) and actively developing the soothing system through practices like compassionate imagery, mindful breathing, and self-kindness exercises.

**Theoretical background:** CFT posits that self-criticism often stems from an overactive threat system and an underdeveloped soothing (compassion) system. Therapy aims to rebalance these systems.

**Effectiveness:** Research on CFT is growing, with studies and meta-analyses suggesting it is effective in reducing self-criticism, shame, depression, and anxiety, and in increasing self-compassion and self-esteem. It may be particularly beneficial when standard CBT is less effective due to high shame or self-criticism.
