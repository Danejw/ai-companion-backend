## Full Research

Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) is a time-limited therapy that focuses on the connection between mood and interpersonal relationships. It posits that depression often occurs in the context of interpersonal problems and that resolving these issues can alleviate depressive symptoms. IPT typically focuses on one or two specific interpersonal problem areas: grief (complicated bereavement), interpersonal role disputes (conflicts), role transitions (life changes), or interpersonal deficits (social isolation).

**Theoretical background:** IPT draws from attachment theory and communication theory, emphasizing the impact of relationship quality and social support on mental health.

**Effectiveness:** IPT is an established evidence-based treatment for major depression. Meta-analyses indicate its efficacy is comparable to CBT and antidepressant medication, particularly for moderate to severe depression. It is also used for other conditions like bipolar disorder and eating disorders.
