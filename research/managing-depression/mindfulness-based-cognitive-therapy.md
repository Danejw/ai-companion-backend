# Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)

## Steps

1.  Teach basic mindfulness practices (breath, body, thoughts awareness).
2.  Help clients notice early signs of depressive relapse.
3.  Train responding mindfully rather than reacting automatically.
4.  Develop skills for accepting negative emotions without judgment.
5.  Practice ongoing mindfulness to maintain emotional regulation.

## Full Research

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an adaptation of MBSR specifically designed to prevent relapse in individuals with recurrent depression. It combines elements of CBT with mindfulness meditation practices. The core aim is to help individuals become more aware of their thoughts and feelings, particularly early warning signs of relapse, and to relate to them in a non-judgmental, accepting way rather than getting caught in ruminative cycles that can trigger a full depressive episode.

**Theoretical background:** MBCT integrates cognitive theory (understanding how negative thought patterns contribute to relapse) with mindfulness principles (developing a different relationship to those thoughts).

**Effectiveness:** MBCT has strong empirical support for preventing depressive relapse, particularly for individuals with a history of three or more major depressive episodes. Meta-analyses show it significantly reduces the risk of recurrence compared to usual care and can be as effective as maintenance antidepressant medication.
