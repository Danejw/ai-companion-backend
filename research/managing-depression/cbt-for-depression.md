## Full Research

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression is based on the principle that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and that changing negative thought patterns and inactive behaviors can alleviate depressive symptoms. Therapy typically involves identifying and challenging negative automatic thoughts (e.g., hopelessness, worthlessness) using techniques like thought records. It also incorporates behavioral activation â€“ encouraging clients to schedule and engage in activities that provide pleasure or a sense of accomplishment, countering withdrawal and inactivity.

**Theoretical background:** Based primarily on Beck's cognitive model of depression, which posits that negative views about the self, the world, and the future (the "cognitive triad") maintain depression.

**Effectiveness:** CBT is one of the most well-established and effective psychotherapies for major depressive disorder. Numerous meta-analyses confirm its efficacy for acute treatment and in preventing relapse. It performs comparably to antidepressant medication for mild to moderate depression and is often recommended as a first-line treatment.
