## Full Research

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn. It teaches participants systematic mindfulness practices to cultivate present-moment awareness and reduce stress. Core components include formal meditation techniques (like the body scan, sitting meditation focusing on breath, and mindful movement/yoga) and informal practices integrated into daily life. The emphasis is on non-judgmental observation of thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations as they arise.

**Theoretical background:** MBSR draws from Buddhist contemplative traditions but is presented in a secular format. It aims to change one's relationship to stressful experiences by fostering acceptance and reducing habitual reactivity.

**Effectiveness:** MBSR has been studied for various conditions, including anxiety and stress. Meta-analyses suggest it can lead to moderate improvements in anxiety symptoms, particularly for individuals with generalized anxiety disorder or high stress levels. It's often considered helpful for managing stress and improving overall well-being, though its effects specifically on diagnosed anxiety disorders might be less pronounced than therapies like CBT.
