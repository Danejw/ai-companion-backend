## Full Research

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for anxiety focuses on identifying and changing unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety disorders. It involves psychoeducation about the nature of anxiety, learning skills to challenge negative automatic thoughts (cognitive restructuring), and gradually facing feared situations (exposure). Behavioral techniques like relaxation training may also be included. The goal is to help clients develop more adaptive coping strategies and reduce avoidance behaviors.

**Effectiveness:** CBT is one of the most empirically supported treatments for anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Numerous meta-analyses demonstrate its efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms compared to control conditions, with effects often maintained long-term.
